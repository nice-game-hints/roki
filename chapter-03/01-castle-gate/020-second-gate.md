title: The second portcullis
---

This is obvious, there is a presser plate in the middle. Standing there opens the hatch with the lever. ^[ Henrik can stand on the plate while Tove will pull the lever. ]

# But the counterweight
Yeah, the right counterweight is clearly missing a stone.

# Where is the stone?
It is on the ledge where *Tove* got the sun disk.

# I have the stone now
*Henrik* can climb up the ladders and put the stone on the right counterweight. The portcullis will open now from the lever. You get to [the castle courtyard](../02-castle/index.md).
