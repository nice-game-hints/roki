title: The first portcullis
---

Henrik and Tove are in front of the first portcullis.

# How to open it?
The two discs must be the solution. *Henrik* can just go and grab the moon disc from the wolf.

# How about the left disc on the stag?
It is too far up, even for Henrik. You would need to get on that ledge.

# How?
Have you explored the area thoroughly?

# Apparently not!
Explore *behind* the raven statue.

# Bars!
Yup, Tove's way in.

# They are not wide enough
*Henrik* can pull the bars wide apart. After that *Tove* gets in.

# She's in
Now *Tove* can climb up the wall and grab the sun disc held by the stag's antlers.

# I have both of them
*Tove* can now insert them into the slots to open the first portcullis. Now, [open the second one](020-second-gate.md).
