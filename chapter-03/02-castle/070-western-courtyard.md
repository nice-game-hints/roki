The interesting part here is the sluice port.

# What about it?
There is a door down there with climbing rocks. But the handholds don't go near enough?

# What to do?
Use the machinery. [There is that gear that you need](075-supply-gear.md), first.

# I have the gear
Try out the machinery with it. You can insert it to one of the slots (and remove it) to get that handle to work.

# It is too rusty
You need to [oil the gear](077-oil-gear.md).

# I have the oiled gear
Now, the right handle will pump some water into the sluice. The left handle will move the gate up and down.

# What to do?
Fill it with water...

# So?
*Henrik* will lower the gate with the left handle and pump the water in with the right handle. Move the oily gear, also.

# It is filled with water
Great! Now *Tove* can climb down and head [into the tunnels](080-supply-tunnel.md).
