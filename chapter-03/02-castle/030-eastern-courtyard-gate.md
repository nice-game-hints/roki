title: Getting to the Eastern Courtyard
---

The way to the eastern courtyard (from the same yard with the dungeon door) is blocked by yet another portcullis.

# How to open it?
From a lever, like all of them. ^[ The lever is on the same wall, a little bit higher. ]

# I see the lever!
Now, *Tove* could climb up there and pull the lever.

# Could!
There's a frozen crack. She can't get hold of it.

# What to do?
You could help her climb it. If she just would have some climbing gear.

# Climbing gear!
Oh yeah. There was this box of climbing gear behind the bear statue, at the first gate.

# I have the climbing piton
*Henrik* can use the piton on the crack to make it easier for *Tove* to climb.

# Not with his bare hands
Oh, get some helping tool. ^[ There is a hammer in the dungeon. *Henrik* must take it. ]

# I have it
Now, *Henrik* must hammer the piton into the crack. *Tove* climbs up and pulls the lever and the portcullis opens. You can now enter the [Eastern Courtyard](035-eastern-courtyard.md).
