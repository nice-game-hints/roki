You get here by starting from [the well](010-well.md).

# Done all that
So, here be more ravens, more cages. The key to the door left is behind the third raven.

# More fruits?
You got it. *Tove* can find the first fruit stairs down.

# How about the cage?
*Henrik* can lift it with the lever on the left. ^[ Again, *Henrik* will open the cage and *Tove* puts the fruit in. ]

# Gotcha!
Great. Now, do [the same two more times](055-second-cage.md).

# All three caught up!
*Tove* can now get the key and *Henrik* can open the door to the Eastern Guard Tower and all the way down back to the main courtyard ^[ *Henrik* can open the guard tower door. ]. Next up is the [Western Supply Courtyard](060-western-courtyard-gate.md).
