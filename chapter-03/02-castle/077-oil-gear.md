title: Oiling the gear
---

The sluice mahicnery, and [the gear](075-supply-gear.md), are rusty. They would need some oil.

# Where to get oil?
You have to make it yourself.

# From what?
Has *Tove* searched the main courtyard? ^[ There's that pool of something red next to the Raven Gate. ]

# You mean the seeds?
*Oily* seeds. Use them to oil the gear.

# Not working
You need to grind them first. Was there a mortar somewhere? ^[ You find the pestle and mortar in one of the prisons. *Henrik* must widen the bars, first. And *Tove* can get it. ]

# I have the mortar
So, grind the seeds in the mortar and then use the oily pulp on the gear.
