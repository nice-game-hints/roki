After solving the sluice Tove is now in the tunnel, beneath the room. It would be nice to have Henrik in the room above.

# But the door
The door is blocked by woody roots. Henrik would need a tool.

# A tool?
The dark tunnel *Tove* is now has an axe. ^[ *Tove* will pick the axe and *Henrik* will use it on the roots. ]

# Henrik is in
Grab the key...

# The key!
Oh no... [Get the key back](085-key.md).

# I have the key
Great. *Henrik* can then open the door into [the torch room](090-torch-room.md).
