title: Exiting the dungeon
---

Tove climbed into the dungeon through the well.

# She can't get back up!
No worries. Just escape the prison.

# How?
Squeeze through the bars and head right. There you find two ravens sitting.

# I'm there
Take the key from the other.

# I got the key
And open the door.

# It can't be opened from inside
But *Henrik* can open it from outside. ^[ Head right from the well to get to a small yard. The dungeon door is on the north wall. Open it with the key. ]

# The door is open
*Tove* can get out then. And you can next try to [open the gate to the eastern courtyard](030-eastern-courtyard-gate.md).
