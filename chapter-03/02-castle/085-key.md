title: The key in the tunnel
---

Henrik dropped the key through the floorboard! Tove must get it back now.

# But it is so dark
*Henrik* can shed light to the tunnel for Tove by opening one of the floorboards at a time.

# Okay
So, now *Henrik* should just show Tove some light. The middle board shows light to the key.

# But it is so far down
You need some helping tool to fish it up.

# What?
A fishing rod. *Henrik* can pick the old fish hook.

# I have the hook
Now just some twine. ^[ *Henrik* can open the right top floorboard and *Tove* can open the chest. There's some twine. ]

# I found twine
Combine them in the inventory.

# It is not long enough
I said fishin *rod*.

# What to use?
You have carried it with you all the time. ^[ Attach the twine and the hook into the spear. ]

# I have a fishing rod!
Great! Now fish the key back.
