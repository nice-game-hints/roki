title: Opening the Tower (Raven) Gate
---

This is your ultimate goal. You have to solve all of [the previous puzzles](index.md), first.

# I have solved
So, you have solved the sundial and the bookshelf?

# Yes
Then you should have found the two signet rings. One inside the bookshelf and the other going down the sundial stairs and taking it from the prisoner.

# I have two signet rings
Okay. Then, open the gate.

# How?
Go through the guard towers. *Henrik* from the other and *Tove* from the other. The signet rings must be inserted into the gate-opening mechanism the same time. The gate will open.
