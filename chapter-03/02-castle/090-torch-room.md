title: The Torch Room
---

There are two closed doors in the Torch Room.

# How to open them
You know why this is called *the Torch Room*?

# Why?
You open the doors by putting torches into the slots. Do you have the torches?
 - One from the supply courtyard ^[ Go downstairs on the yard to find it. ]
 - One in this building ^[ *Henrik* will lifth the floorboard on bottom left. *Tove* can then open the chest and find the torch. ]

# I have two torches
And the third was already in the room. Put the torches into their places and tilt them.

# Nothing happens
Oh, they have to be in correct places.

# Correct?
Look closely the slots and the torches.

# Hmmm...
They have number of lines. Match the lines and you get the doors open. ^[ You have to tilt all of them, too. ]

# Doors open
Now you can get to [the dining hall](100-dining-hall.md) from the right hand door.
