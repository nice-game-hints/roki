title: First dining room riddle
---

For the first riddle you have to insert [the four tiles](../110-four-tiles.md) in correct slots.

# I have the tiles. What was the riddle, again?
*With spring didst the New Year begin. The seasons broke the pattern. For every one, two were foregone. Three whole years this madness would last.*

The other way to solve this is to look at [the tattered banners](10-banners.md).

# Help me with the riddle
*With spring didst the New Year begin.*

Start with spring (the flower tile) in the left.

# Okay
*The seasons broke the pattern. For every one, two were foregone.*

Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter is the normal pattern, right?

# Right?
So, for every one (Spring), skip two. Spring, ~~Summer~~, ~~Autumn~~, Winter. So Winter is next.

# Okay, tell me the final order
Spring, Winter...

# More!
...Autumn, Summer
