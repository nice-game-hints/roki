title: Second cage
---

The first raven capture was easy. To lift the second cage also up you need some parts.

# What?
The gear. *Tove* can take it after the first raven is captured.

# I have the gear
Put it into the first joint. ^[ *Henrik* must lower the first cage so that the moved cages are in same phase. ]

# It is ready
Now, *Henrik* can lift both cages up.

# They are both up
*Henrik* will open the door and *Tove* will put the fruit bait ^[ You can find the fruit on top of the tower. *Tove* will climb it.] in.

# It is not coming
The first raven is warning it about the trap.

# Cunning!
Indeed. You should get rid of that tell-tale.

# How?
Lower it down while you bait the second one. ^[ Remove the gear and pull the lever. Now only the second cage is up. Catch the raven. ]

# And the third?
Same idea. The fruit and another gear are on the ledge on right *Tove* can now access. You have to fiddle with the lever and the gears to get the third cage alone.

# So?
*Henrik* will raise the first cage from the lever. Add a gear into the first joint. Lower both cages. Add a gear into the second joint. Raise all three cages. Remove the second gear. Lower the first and second cage with the lever. Open the cage and insert the fruit.
