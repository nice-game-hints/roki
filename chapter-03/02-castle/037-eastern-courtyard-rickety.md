title: Rickety Cart (at Eastern Courtyard)
---

The wooden rickety cart acts as a seesaw. You can walk there using the fallen stairs.

# What to do with it?
You can use it to access that object up there.

# How?
*Henrik* can stand on the left side of the cart to lift the right side up.

# And?
*Tove* can walk on the right side and then she can take the object. ^[ The object is a tile with a snowflake. Interesting. ]
