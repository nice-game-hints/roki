There are total of four tiles to find around the castle.

# Where?
 - Eastern Courtyard ^[ Use [the rickety cart](037-eastern-courtyard-rickety.md) to get the snowflake tile. ]
 - Eastern Guard Tower ^[ *Henrik* can move the shield. *Tove* can then see and pick the exposed leaf tile. ]
 - Supply Building ^[ After resolving the [Torch Room] *Tove* can enter the supply building (with the loose floorboards) and climb for the flower tile. ]
 - Western Guard Tower ^[ *Henrik* can take the sun tile from the wall. ]
