A poem:
 "With spring didst the New Year begin. The seasons broke the pattern. For every one, two were foregone. Three whole years this madness would last."

Top row: water stuff (fish book)
Middle row: earth (tree book)
Bottom row: sky (bird book)

Needs Henrik to put the books in place.


wolf Sundial Puzzle:
 - look at it
  - There is a note on the bench (as Henrik): "What is this strange sundial, I'm sure it has significance. The men refuse to linger whilst I investigate further. I don't blame them. Some invisible evil lurks here. I swear there are noises. Inhuman whispers."
 - "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west."
 - "The wolf begins its pursuit of the sun at dawn and chases it until dusk."
 - "Only at twilight will the wolf retreat to her underground lair."

The ball on the right is the sun.
Set the sunrise to east (right), sun to north (top), sunset to west (left) and star to south (bottom).

Now the sun can be moved. Tove can open the small markers and Henrik the large markers. You have to alternate between them to let the sun move forward unstopped.
