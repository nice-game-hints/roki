title: Descending into the well
---

The well is shut with a lid.

# How to open it?
*Henrik* would need some leverage to open it.

# Leverage?
Did *Tove* explore the areas she could? ^[ She can climb into the left ramparts. There's bricks to climb left of the rRaven Gate. ]

# Yes, she got there
To the left tower? Then she also saw the dead guard.

# Yes
And its spear?

# Spear!
*Henrik* can use the spear to open the well. *Tove* can then [climb into the well](020-dungeons.md).
