At the western supply courtyard there's a gear on the stair above the rickety cart.

# How to get it?
You should tilt the cart so that it can be grabbed.

# So, Henrik will stand right and Tove will get it?
It is not that easy... Tove can't reach it. She is too short. It has to be Henrik.

# But he weights too much
You need some counterweight.

# What?
Stones. Two stones. ^[ Other stone is stairs down and the other is other side of the sluice machinery. Only *Henrik* can take it.] 

# I have two stones
Put them on the cart. There is now counterweight.

# Not enough
And add *Tove*. Two stones and one Tove is more than one Henrik. *Henrik* can now grab the gear.
