The waytree at Poisoned Forest is in trouble. Free it!

# How?
First, use the sword on the tentacles.

# Still not open
Scare away the ravens that are pecking its roots.

# Where?
On the left and on the right. Just run on the ravens.

# And the last?
The last root is behind the runes. Scare the raven away.
