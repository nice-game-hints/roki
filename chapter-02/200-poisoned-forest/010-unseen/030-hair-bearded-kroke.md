One ingredient for the invisibility mask is hair of a bearded kroke.

# Bearded kroke?
Krokelings like to spend time in watery places. You are looking a *bigger* krokeling for this.

# Where to get hints?
Talk to Trollhulde about this.

# Bridge!
Yes, the watermill bridge. She said it is infested with krokelings. There's stairs down before the watermill.

# How to find the creature?
You need just good luck.

# Good luck?
Others have tried to get good luck by throwing [coins](060-coin.md) into the lake.

# I have coins!
Throw them into the lake then.

# Mamma Kroke!
Luckily she didn't eat you! You just have to find and return her three sons.

# Three sons?
There are three *krokelings* to find and return to her.

 - [The hiding krokeling](../090-creature-sunken-cabin.md) ^[ It is at the sunken cabin]
 - [The krokeling in the Poisoned Forest](../030-krokeling.md)

# I have them
Return them to Momma! She will offer her beard to you. ^[ Cut some hair with the sword. ]
