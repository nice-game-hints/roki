Tossing a coin into the pond next to the watermill would bring good luck.

# Where is the coin?
You have to search *and dig* around.

# Dig? Where?
On your way into [the Poisoned Forest](../060-sharp-dagger.md). There's a mound of earth with a sign.

# What should I dig it with?
Did you find [the cave of potions](../050-runes.md)?

# Yes
Dig the mound with the trowel. You get some gold coins.
