The Poisoned Forest can see you and block your way.

# How to hide?
You should make yourself *invisible*.

# How?
The anser lies in [the three mysterious runes](../050-runes.md).

# It is open
Did you pick up the stuff ^[ The empty jar and the trowel] in the cave of potions?

# I did!
Then you must have got the list of ingredients for the mask. Here it is:
 - [A Ram's skull](010-rams-skull.md)
 - [Two Nattamare Parasites](020-two-nattamare-parasites.md)
 - [Hair of Bearded Kroke](030-hair-bearded-kroke.md)
