One of the krokelings is living in the pond at the Poisoned Forest.

# He won't come
Yeah, he doesn't want to leave the pond. You need to trap it.

# How?
You need some kind of a tool that catches water creatures.

# What is that?
Have you met Nokken? ^[ Start the seek of the missing wolf staff from [the Wolf Ruins](../300-wolf-ruins/index.md). ]

# Yes I have.
You need the lobster pot. ^[ You can find it from Nokken's cave, in a crate near the tea party area. ]

# I have it!
Use it in the pond to catch the krokeling. Take it from the trap.
