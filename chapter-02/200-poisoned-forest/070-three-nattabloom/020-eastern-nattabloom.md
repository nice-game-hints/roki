title: Eastern nattabloom
---

There is one nattabloom in the area where you get by going to the right, to the eastern entryway.

# How to cross the river?
Put on your all-seeing mask to see the mushroom bridge.

# How to go over the gap?
Did you [free the trapped Ã¤lva](005-alva.md), already?

# Yes
Then you must have the wand. ^[ Use the wand on the mushrooms growing from the ledge and the fallen tree. ]

# I found the nattabloom!
Good. But how to reach it?

# Yes, how?
You would need some sort of stairs.

# Stairs?
Like, mushroom stairs.

# Where do I get those?
Actually, you have used them, already.

# Tell me
Go to the main area and shrink the mushroom stairs leading to the northern area. Dig them up with your trowel.

# I have the stairs mushroom
Plant it into the mulch and grow it to reach the nattabloom.

# How to get a sample?
Use your dagger on the nattabloom.
