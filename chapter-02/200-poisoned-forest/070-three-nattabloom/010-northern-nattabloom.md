title: Northern nattabloom
---

There is one nattabloom in the area where you get by using the mushroom "stairs" left of the main entrance.

# What to do?
Put on your mask of all-seeing. Do you see the creature [trapped in the toadstool](005-alva.md)?

# It is free!
Well done. You have the magic wand and the largened toadstool lets you access the upper area.

# I get there
There you have to get through the tentacles. ^[ Use the invisibility mask to make them disappear. ]

# Yup. What next?
Put on the all-seeing mask to see the hidden stairs. Walk up there.

# Dead end
Not necessarily. You just got a new item.

# You mean?
Use the magic wand to grow the mushrooms growing in the trees to reach the nattabloom.

# How to get a sample?
Use your dagger on the nattabloom.
