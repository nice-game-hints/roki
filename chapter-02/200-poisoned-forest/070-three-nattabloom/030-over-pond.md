title: Nattabloom over the pond
---

There is an entryway over the pond in the Poisoned Forest main area.

# How to reach it?
Use the all-seeing mask. You can see the hidden mushroom incline.

# But the tentacles block my way
Switch back to the Mask of Invisibility.

# Of course!
In the area walk on top of the ledge. You can see the nattabloom.

# How to get it?
I think those three mulch piles are the key.

# What to do?
Did you [free the trapped älva](005-alva.md), already?

# Yes
Find three mushrooms and plant them and grow them to create a bridge to the nattabloom.

# Where are the mushrooms?
 - One mushroom is in this area. ^[ Right after the bridge. ]
 - One mushroom is in the northern area, where you go by the mushroom "stairs". ^[ Go down the hole in the ground (can be seen with the mask) in the middle of the mushroom circle. Shrink the mushroom and dig it up with the trowel.
 - One mushroom is in the eastern area. ^[ After the bridge next to an älva house. ]

# I have three
Plant them and grow them. You have to plant them in correct order ^[ From left to right: large, medium, small. ]

# How to get a sample?
Use your dagger on the nattabloom.
