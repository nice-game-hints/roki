title: Freeing the stag guardian horn
---

The horn to wake up the stag guardian is infested with fungus.

# What to do?
Shroomi, at the cave of potions, has an answer.

# So
[Find the three nattablooms](070-three-nattabloom/index.md) and put them into the cauldron.

# I have it
You now have the potent poison to deal with the blocking fungus.

# What to do with it?
Shroomi said you have to deliver it *deep* for it to take hold.

# Deep?
Combine the poison with your dagger. Hit the fungus with your poisoned dagger to free the horn.
