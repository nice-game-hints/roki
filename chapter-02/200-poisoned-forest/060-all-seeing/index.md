Another mask, another list of ingredients.

# Show me the ingredients
This is the list. Here's a general hint about them ^[ All the ingredients can be found in the Poisoned Forest. You have to have the Mask of Invisibility on. ]
 - [The orb of an eye-orb fungus](010-eye-orb.md)
 - [One portion of newt spawn](020-newt-spawn.md)
 - Owl skull ^[ Enter the entryway with the mushroom "stairs". Go up the incline and destroy the tentacles using your dagger. The skull is behind the tentacles. ]
 - Three bluecap toadstools:
   - North one ^[ Enter the entryway with the mushroom "stairs". Use the dagger on the tentacles after the entry. ]
   - East one ^[ Enter the eastern entryway, on the right. Look for the mushroom trail up there. It is there to take. ]
   - Stag one ^[ Enter the main entryway in the middle. It is on your way up to the Stag guardian. Almost when you are at the top. Use the object flash button to see it. ]
