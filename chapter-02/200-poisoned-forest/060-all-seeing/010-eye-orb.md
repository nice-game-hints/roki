title: The orb of an eye-orb fungus
---

It is somewhere in the Poisoned Forest.

# Where?
Eye-orbs. Where have you seen those?

# Where?
They are *eye-balling* you in the main area. Both sides of the main entryway.

# Oh, those. Can't reach them.
There's a third one.

# Where?
Next to the eastern entryway, on the right near the pond. It is lower. Go and get it.
