Tove is drawing... with *knitting needles*.

# That can't be
Fix the scene.

# How?
Pappa was painting the crib with crayons.

# How to get them?
Give him the correct tool.

# What tool?
Go up the middle branch until you find a paintbrush. ^[ It is in the toolbox, next to the car. ] Give it to Pappa and take the crayons.

# I have the crayons
Give them to Tove. You get the knitting needles from the table.
