There's a *drawn* door and rectangle in the floor with a key.

# Weird...
Maybe you should fill the missing pieces.

# Fill?
Like, put the door mat on top of the rectangle.

# What else?
It needs a lock (to put the key in) and a knob.

# Where are they?
You can find the knob in the cupboard. The diary on the left has a lock. Put them both into the door.

# Real door!
Open the door with the key.

# Key?
It was drawn. ^[ The key is under the mat. ]
