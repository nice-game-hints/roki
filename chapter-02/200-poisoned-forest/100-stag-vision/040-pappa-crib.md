Pappa is painting the crib... with *crayons*.

# That can't be
Fix the scene.

# How?
Give him the correct tool.

# What tool?
Go up the middle branch until you find a paintbrush. You need to [go over the gap](030-gap.md). ^[ The paintbrush is in the toolbox, next to the car. ] Give it to Pappa. ^[ Take the crayons. ]

# Next?
Get the paint tin from [Pappa fixing the car](060-pappa-car.md).

# I have it
Put it on the magazines.
