Pappa is fixing the car... with *paint*.

# That can't be
Fix the scene.

# How?
Mamma is staring at the spanner. I think it is better used for car fixing. [Get it.](070-mamma-knit.md)

# I have it, but the tentacles block
Something else in the scene was off.

# The toolbox!
Put the screwdriver ^[ It is holding the huge knitted scarf. ] into the toolbox. You can now give the spanner to Pappa. Take the paint tin.
