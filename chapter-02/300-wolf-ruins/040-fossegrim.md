Fossegrim lives in the icy cave next to the Mountain Plateau. He told you about the way to make water dance.

# What do I need to do?
You have to:
 - Charge the three thirsty stones. Charge them in three watery places:
  - One that was large but now small ^[ The stream that goes under Trollhilde's bridge. ]
  - One that was clean, but now tainted ^[ There's that tainted pond in the Poisoned Forest. ]
  - One that hides a tragic secret long forgotten ^[ This refers to the pond that is in the cave right of Nokken's pond. ]
 - [Get the instrument to enhance](../../160-flute.md)
 - Offering of food. ^[ [The Yule Cat](../../170-yule-cat.md) has some meat baking. ]

# I have all of them
Three charged stones, the flute and the meat from the Yule Cat? Nice. Take them to Fossegrim. He will teach you how to make the water dance.
