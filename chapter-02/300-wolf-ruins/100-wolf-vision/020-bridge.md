To get over the gap and to the fishing picture you need a bridge.

# How?
Find some straight objects that you could spread as a bridge.

# You mean?
Straws. There are three straws. ^[ Two in the birthday picture and one in the camping picture. ]

# I have the three straws
Great. Tie them together with the rope and put it as a bridge.
