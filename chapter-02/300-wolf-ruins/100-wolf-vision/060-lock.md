Pappa's fishing box is locked by a code.

# Where to get it?
Was there another picture where the fishing box was open?

# There was
Go to the camping picture and look at the fishing box. You see the code.

# But only two last numbers
Oh, yeah. They were 0 and 5.

# How about the first numbers
Tove's Pappa would definitely use something personal for the code.

# Like?
His daughter's birthday. ^[ Go into the birthday picture and look the calendar. ]

# So the code is...
Tove's birthday is 17th of May so the code is **1705**. You get a fishing hook from the box.
