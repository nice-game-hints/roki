The hand is holding the locket.

# How to force it to drop?
You would need to throw it with something sharp.

# Like?
Like [a fishing hook](060-lock.md).

# I got it
Can you hit it from the below?

# No?
So, go to the ledge on the right. You need to [climb up there](070-get-up.md).

# I am up there
Walk to the left and use the fishing hook on the hand.

# It dropped it!
Go get it. You need to get past [the ringed hand](040-white-hand.md) and [the red decorated hand](050-red-hand.md).
