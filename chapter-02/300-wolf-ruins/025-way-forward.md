There's *huge* gap at the mountain plateau. Clearly, the other wolf staff is missing. [Find and return it.](030-missing-staff.md)

# I returned it
Good. Did you notice you can rotate the staffs.

# I can!
Look at the other wolf statues.

# They are...
...facing each other. Rotate the wolf staffs until the statues face each other.
