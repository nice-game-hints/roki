Torch is a handy tool that can shed light to dark caves you may encounter.

# How to build one?
Well, you need a handle, some burning material and matches. But first, you should get to Nokken. ^[ You get to Nokken when you start searching for the missing wolf staff. ]

# I know Nokken. Tell me where to find the parts.
Here they are:
 - A handle ^[ Grab a bone from the cave next to the Nokken's pond. ]
 - Burning material ^[ Take a rag from Yule Cat's burrow. The burrow can be found in a small clearing between Trollhulde's cave and the spiky pit. ]
 - Matches ^[ You find matches from the watermill. On top of the barrel. ]
