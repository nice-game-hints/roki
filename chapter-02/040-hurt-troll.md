Trollhilde is hurt. There is a dagger stuck on her back and she cannot reach it.

# What to do?
You need to build a helping tool. First, you need rope.

# Rope!
There's some rope in [the church](03-church-gate.md).

# I got the rope
Great, and next attach something into it. Something that can *catch* the dagger.

# Like?
Like a bear trap ^[ You find the bear trap inside the sunken cabin. Enter the cabin from the side. ].

# I got the bear trap, too
Very well. Combine the bear trap with the rope.

# And?
Use it on the dagger on Trollhilde.
