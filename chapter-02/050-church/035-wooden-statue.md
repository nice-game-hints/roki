title: Wooden statue (on the tomb building wall)
---

There is a strange statue on the wall of the tomb building, next to the church.

# It is loose, how to get it?
You would need some tool to help.

# What tool?
Like a hammer or similar. Have you [woken the Mother Tree](../050-mother-tree.md)?

# Yes
Then you should have found the watermill and the mallet. ^[ Take the mallet from the watermill basement. ]

# I have the mallet
Use the mallet on the statue.

# It doesn't work
From the *inside* of the tomb building. That will let the statue go. Pick it up.
