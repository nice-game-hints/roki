There's an uninviting gorge east of [the Mother Tree](050-mother-tree.md).

# How to get over it?
The solution lies on the unhealthy tree. It can be used as a bridge.

# How?
Go explore other things. There isn't much you can do now.

# Especially what?
Go to the [Wolf Ruins](300-wolf-ruins/index.md).
