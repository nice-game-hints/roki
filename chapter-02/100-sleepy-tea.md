Trollhilde would like to taste some human tea.

# Where to?
Have you got accesss to [the east side](050-mother-tree.md) of the forest, yet?

# I have
Then you have found Trollhulde and her recipe book, also. Read the book ^[ three times] to find the recipe for sleepy tea.

# I have the recipe
The flowers can be found while solving other problems. Keep you eyes peeled.

# Tell me more
Here's the flowers and where you find them.
- Valerian-of-the-Mountain flower ^[ The flower can be found from the Mountain Plateau, after the [Wolf Ruins](300-wolf-ruins/index.md). ]
- Whispervine flower ^[ You find Whispervine flower on top of the church. Climb the ladders all the way to the top. ]
- Sopor Lily ^[ You find sopor lily at the pond when you are looking for the [Wolf Staff](300-wolf-ruins/030-missing-staff.md). ]

# I have the three flowers
Put them into the mortar at Trollhulde's cavern. You get some tea powder.

# I have the tea powder
Great. Now off to Trollhilde. Put the powder into the cauldron. ^[ Use the matches to fire up the fireplace. ]
