[The dagger](04-hurt-troll.md) is rusty and blunt.

# Where to?
Did you talk to the Tree of Many. ^[ It says there is nothing on *this* side of the forest.]

# The other side?
Your way to the other side of the forest is blocked by [the Mother Tree](05-mother-tree.md).

# I woke her!
Now the door is open to the right. Go explore!

# What am I looking for?
A grindstone. ^[ There is one in the basement of the watermill. Use the ladders to get down there. ]

# I found it!
It is not turning... And the cogs are too heavy.

# What to do?
Did you spot the ceremonial bowl and markings up there?

# Yes?
[Summon the Tomte to help you.](120-summon-tomte.md)

# Did it!
The grindstone works now. Sharpen the blunt dagger on it.
