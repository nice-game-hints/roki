Maybe Nokken is just lonely and needs someone to accompany it.

# Not me!
Of course not. But maybe something that looks like you.

# Like?
Like the doll that is riding the horse toy. Take it and put it on the "chair". ^[ You have to try out at least once to enable the "chair". ]

# Didn't fool it
Make it look more like you.

# What do I need?
 - Dress ^[ Blue fabric from the miniature ship, on the left. ]
 - A hat ^[ Red bowl from the bottom drawer. ]
 - Boots ^[ The red wellies on top of the box, right of the drawer. ]

# Got them
Combine them with the doll and sit it on the box.
