title: Re-entering Nokken's cave
---

The entry to Nokken's cave, at the cave next to the Nokken's pond, is filled with water.

# How to remove the water?
I think there was a mention about commanding water with music.

# There was!

# I can command water!
Well, use your magic flute on the pond to remove the water.

# Nokken is still there
[Liberate her.](040-liberate.md)
