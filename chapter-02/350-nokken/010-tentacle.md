title: Getting past Nokken's tentacle
---

Nokken's tentacle is blocking your way to the left.

# What to do?
Maybe you could throw something into the water to distract it.

# What?
Its toy?

# So?
The teddy bear. Take it and put it into the water. The tentacle puts the teddy bear back. ^[ You have to time your run so that you make it before the tentacle is back. ]
