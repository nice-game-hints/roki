There is that mysterious creature in the sunken cabin. Inside the broken barrell.

# How to get it out?
I wants a snack before it will come out.

# A snack?
Okay, one question, first. Did you [wake the Mother Tree](050-mother-tree.md), already?

# I did
And did you find Trullhulde's cave? ^[ It is there, after the Mother Tree door. ]

# I did, yes
Okay, back to the snack. Did you find it?

# What is it?
How about a juicy slug? ^[ You find a slug in Trullhulde's cave. Go to the recipe book and the look right bottom corner. You can follow the trail. ]

# I have the slug!
Great, give it to the mystery creature in the sunken cabin.
