The second room contains a disc puzzle. You have to find four discs and put them in correct places.

# Where do I find them?
 - One is already there, but in incorrect slot. Pick it up.
 - Second is in the crypt. ^[ Go *right* from the bell. There's more tombs and a disc. ]

# What about the third?
Have you visited the Poisoned Forest, already? Did you [open the runes](../200-poisoned-forest/050-runes.md)?

# Yes
Third one is in the church area, but not in the church. ^[ There is the smaller vault building outside. Go search from there. ]

# More hints on the third
Dig it up inside the vault building. ^[ Use the trowel you find from the cave of potions, in the bottom drawer, in the Poisoned Forest. ]

# I got it. And the fourth?
Have you gone to the [Wolf Ruins](../300-wolf-ruins/index.md), already?

# I have
So you got to the mountain plateau. There is an interesting cave if you go the ladders up.

# It is dark
Make [some light](../180-torch.md). ^[ After using the torch the disc is there to take. ]

# Got it
You now have all four. Put them in correct slots. This is an easy one.
