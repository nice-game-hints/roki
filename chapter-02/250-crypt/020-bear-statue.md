There is a bear statu in the end of the crypt. The stone blocks are the key. You need four of them.

# Four?
Two are in place. One can be found in the crypt ^[ Go left and get rid of the spider web to find it in the tomb. ]

# And the last one?
Have you met Nokken, yet? ^[ Start finding the missing wolf staff, first. Head to [Wolf Ruins](../300-wolf-ruins/index.md) ]

# Yes
The fourth stone block is at the *tea party* area in Nokken's cave, next to the cupboard. ^[ You can [revisit Nokken's cave](../350-nokken/030-reenter-cave.md). ]

# I have all four stone blocks
Good. Then just insert them in the correct order.

# Any hints for the order?
The hint is right there: the crescent moon.

# Crescent moon?
Have you spotted moon symbol anywhere else? ^[ Look closely in the church. ]

# More hints
Walk around in the church. There's those four stone memorials. One of them has a crescent moon.

# Found it!
*Karl Karlsson - 1623*

# So?
You had four blocks: 1, 2, 3 and 6.

# Oh!
Put them in matching order into the sockets: 1, 6, 2, 3
