The chief tomte will help you out. He just needs more power.

# How?
You need to free all tomtes to help him. Start from the one in the left. ^[ Use the dagger to free him. ]

# Others?
One was down there when you used the mirrors. You have to climb down there.

# More?
Climb all the way up. There is one.

# More?
That's it. Go stand on that stone.

# Still not working
Oh, talk to them so that all four tomtes are dancing.
