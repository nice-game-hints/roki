Lars is air drumming. Maybe he should not be *just* air drumming.

# You mean?
Build him a drum set.

# How?
You need three noisy items:
 - Coffee cup ^[ On the porch. Empty the cup into the bowl of water. ]
 - Flower pot ^[ On the porch. ]
 - [Cooking pot](050-cooking-pot.md)

# I have them
Give them to Lars. You get the last song sheet.
