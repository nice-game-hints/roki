You can find the windchime from the dream where Lars is. Put it to its place.

# What is that?
There is a hook on the porch.

# It is not windy
Listen to the radio. There will be a forecast.

# Okay
It says it will be windy at quarter to one.

# And?
Go look at the clock on the porch wall. Put it to 12:45. The short hand will point straight up and the long hand straight to the left.

# It starts to wind
And you should get a song sheet. Go put it on the piano.
