The Mother Tree (or Tree of Doors) is right from the portal clearing.

# How to wake it?
The ravens are disturbing it. Get rid of the ravens.

# How?
You did it already once, remember?

# The outhouse?
Yup. Scare the ravens away. ^[ First, run towards the ravens on the ground. ]

# I chased ones from the ground
Next, the rest up there.

# How?
Use pebbles. You will find them, eventually.

# Where?
[Help Trollhilde](040-hurt-troll.md), first. ^[ After that you get access to her lair. Take the pebbles from the ground. ]

# I got the pebbles
Use them against the ravens.
