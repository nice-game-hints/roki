Porridge is healthy.

# Porridge?
Yeah, you need:
 - Porridge oats ^[ You find porridge oats from the sunken cabin, left of the church. ]
 - [Fresh river water](110-well.md)

# I have those
Then just mix and warm them up. Use the fireplace in the watermill.

# So?
Put the water into the fireplace pot. Put the porridge oats there, also.

# Okay
Then, [fire it up](140-fireplace.md).
