There's a fireplace in the watermill. Fire it up.

# How?
You need some dry wood. ^[ You find some on the ground left of the fireplace. ]

# And matches?
They are on top of the barrel right from the fireplace. Little pixel hunting.

# I got them
Put the wood into the fireplace and fire it up with the matches.
