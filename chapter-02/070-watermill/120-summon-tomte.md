There's a ceremonial bowl and markings for summoning a Tomte in the watermill.

# How to summon it?
It is a hungry creature.

# Hungry?
Maybe you could make [some porridge](130-porridge.md) for it.

# Porridge is ready!
Take some of it into the ceremonial bowl. Put the bowl back into the markings.

# Tomte!
Follow it!
