Yule Cat is in its burrow ^[ The burrow can be found in a small clearing between Trollhulde's cave and the spiky pit. ]

# I found it
It longs for its fur to be back to obsidian splendour.

# Obsidian?
You need something that can color its fur black.

# Like what?
Like ash.

# Where do I get that?
Have you escaped from [Nokken](350-nokken/index.md), yet?

# Yes?
Then you have flooded Trollhilde's cave and shut the fireplace. ^[ There's some black ashy sludge right of the fireplace. ]

# Where do I collect the ash sludge?
Find an empty jar. ^[ Go to the Poisoned Forest and solve [the runes](200-poisoned-forest/050-runes.md). There you find the empty jar. ]

# I have the jar
Great! Collect the ash into the jar and use it on the Yule Cat. ^[ You can now grab the meat. ]
