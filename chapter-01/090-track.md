title: Tracking Lars
---

The monster took Lars! Track him down.

# How?
You can run right or left of the statue. Try them out.

# I keep coming back
Did you try the *both* ways? Tove will say that there must be **another path**.

# Yes, she said that
Look for the other path then. ^[ Run all the way to the left. Near the snowy trees. ]

# I found it!
The marbles are a clue.

# Where next?
Try to find more marbles. If you go to the wrong direction you end up at the statue and have to do it all again.

# Can't find them
Sometimes they are under snow. Examine mounds of snow. Everytime you see marbles, take that exit.

# Examined all the snow mounds
Other clues are *fresh footprints*. If Tove says that a footprint is fresh, take that exit.
