title: Cellar

The monster drove you into the cellar. That red sled would work as an escape vehicle.

# How to get it down?
Did you notice what the monster did when Tove lit the light?

# Light?
Yup. It will break the floor above when the area is lit. You can try with the other lamp.

# So?
There's a flashlight on the box right from the stairs.

# No batteries
You find the first battery just by seeking for it. ^[ Open the lower cupboard door to find a battery. ]

# Found one battery!
Where do you would get another? Something is using a battery right now.

# The robot
[Open the robot.](010-robot.md)

# I have two batteries
Great! Put them into the flashlight and lure the monster.

# How?
Use the flashlight on the red sled. Use the sled to escape.
