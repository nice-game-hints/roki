title: Helping Lars to outhouse
---

To the outhouse. Fix the fire, again, before you go. Open the door.

# The ravens
Lars is afraid of them. Drive them away.

# How?
Just run on the yard.

# They are guarding the toilet
Oh, run away the ravens on top of the outhouse.

# How?
Maybe you could throw them at with something? This is a small pixel hunt.

# Tell me what
Pick up some pebbles near the well. Highlight to see them.
